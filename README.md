## One Line At A Time

.. is a very light app that lets you load a PDF or copy-paste long texts, and then play it back one line at a time.

This was created because I found it difficult sometimes to focus when reading large articles. Reading one line at a time in big letters lets you focus on what is written instead of focus on trying to find where you are in the text.

The PDF reader uses Apache PDFBox API.

## Instructions:
* Choose PDF mode or Text mode (where you copy paste text yourself, if you wish). In PDF mode, specify which page you want to start on, pick your PDF, and go!

## TODO
* Make a better TextReader, which doesnt let too small sentences through (for example Fig. A. B. and such things).
* Make Android app

## Version history
