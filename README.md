##One Line At A Time

.. is a very light app that lets you paste long texts, and then play it back one line at a time.

This was created because I found it difficult sometimes to focus when reading large articles. Reading one line at a time in big letters lets you focus on what is written instead of focus on trying to find where you are in the text.

#Version 0.1:
- Initial commit. Main function is working, you paste text and you can play it line by line. However some easy to implement features are on the way soon:

#TODO
		- Now delimiter (. or ?) isnt shown in the lines output
		- Implement the GOTO button (now does nothing)
		- Implement switching lines with keyboard arrows instead of only mouse (important)
